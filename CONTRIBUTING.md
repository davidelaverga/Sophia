# Clean code

Every rule below is enforced by a tool (`pnpm check`, CI) or by review.
None is a matter of taste. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) holds the repository
contract; this file holds the code rules.

- **Formatting is Prettier's** (`pnpm format`; `.prettierrc.json`: no
  semicolons, single quotes, 120 columns). It is never discussed in review.
  Recorded identities are excluded (`.prettierignore`): `docs/`, `config/`,
  the dsh bundle and runtime packages, generated files.
- **Lint is strict and type-aware** (`pnpm lint`, `.oxlintrc.json`, the
  strict rule set of the pinned dsh repository). Zero findings. A suppression
  is one line with a reason:
  `// oxlint-disable-next-line <rule> -- why`.
- **Small, named pieces.** Functions ≤ 60 lines, complexity ≤ 12, nesting ≤ 3,
  parameters ≤ 5. When something grows, split it by responsibility and name
  each piece for what it does (`readSnapshot` → `readGoals`,
  `readResources`…). The S1-01 composition gate predates the limits and is
  listed as an exception in `.oxlintrc.json`; new code gets none.
- **Types tell the truth.** No `any` (use `unknown` and narrow), no non-null
  `!` where narrowing can do it, `catch (err: unknown)`. JSON crossing a
  boundary is typed with the contract types; runtime validators replace
  those casts as they land.
- **Pure logic apart from I/O and React.** Protocol, ordering and retry logic
  live in plain modules with unit tests (`projection.ts`, `feed-loop.ts`,
  `@sophia/contracts/sse`); components and routes only wire them.
- **One definition.** Extract repeated logic the second time it appears.
  Shared contract code goes in `@sophia/contracts`, UI primitives in
  `@sophia/ui`, script helpers in `scripts/lib/`.
- **Errors are explicit.** Domain errors carry a stable code and retry
  disposition. Database messages never reach users unfiltered. An ignored
  error needs a comment saying why.
- **Comments explain why**, not what. Each module opens with what it
  guarantees and what it does not.
- **Every fix gets a regression test that fails without the fix.** Check it
  by reverting the fix once (a mutation check), and say so in the PR.
- **Tests use `node --test`** with `node:assert/strict`. A test that needs
  PostgreSQL is `*.db.test.ts`; one that needs a Supabase stack is
  `*.live.test.ts`. `pnpm test` runs neither.
